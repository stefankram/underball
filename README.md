# Underball

Underball is 2-D isometric platformer based on the game "Overball" by Wild Tangent.

In Underball, the player controls a sphere placed upon a course which they can roll
using their mouse. The goal is to get to the finish line without falling off the
course. While navigating the course, the player will come across a door which blocks
access to the next section. The player must gather all flowers and crystals before
the door to unlock it. Once the player reaches the end, they win the game!
